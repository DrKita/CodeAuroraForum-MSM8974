	help
	  Enable this option for integrated thermal management support on NVIDIA
	  Tegra124 systems-on-chip. The driver supports four thermal zones
	  (CPU, GPU, MEM, PLLX). Cooling devices can be bound to the thermal
	  zones to manage temperatures. This option is also required for the
	  emergency thermal reset (thermtrip) feature to function.

	  Tegra thermal driver which estimates temperature based
	  off of the weighted sum of a sequence of readings from
	  other sensors. The weights can be customized on a per-platform
	  basis.
