NVIDIA Tegra 30 IOMMU H/W, SMMU (System Memory Management Unit)

Required properties in the IOMMU node:
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra124-smmu", "nvidia,tegra30-smmu"
- reg : Can contain multiple register banks(address and length) for each
  of the SMMU register blocks.
- interrupts : Should contain MC General interrupt.
- nvidia,#asids : # of ASIDs
- dma-window : IOVA start address and length.
- nvidia,ahb : phandle to the ahb bus connected to SMMU.
- iommus: phandle to an iommu device which a device is
  attached to and indicates which swgroups a device belongs to(SWGROUP ID).
  SWGROUP ID is from 0 to 63, and a device can belong to multiple SWGROUPS.
- #iommu-cells. Should be 2. In client IOMMU specifiers, the two cells
  represent a 64-bit bitmask of SWGROUP IDs under which the device
  initiates transactions. The least significant word is first. See
  <dt-bindings/memory/tegra-swgroup.h> for a list of valid values.

Required properties in device nodes affected by the IOMMU:
- iommus: A list of phandle plus specifier pairs for each IOMMU that
  affects master transactions initiated by the device. The number of
  cells in each specifier is defined by the #iommu-cells property in
  the IOMMU node referred to by the phandle. The meaning of the
  specifier cells is defined by the referenced IOMMU's binding.

Example:
	smmu: iommu {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra30-smmu";
		reg = <0x7000f010 0x02c
		       0x7000f1f0 0x010
		       0x7000f228 0x05c>;
		nvidia,#asids = <4>;		/* # of ASIDs */
		dma-window = <0 0x40000000>;	/* IOVA start & length */
		nvidia,ahb = <&ahb>;
		#iommu-cells = <2>;
	};

	host1x {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra30-host1x", "simple-bus";
		iommus = <&smmu TEGRA_SWGROUP_CELLS(HC)>;
		....
		gr3d {
			compatible = "nvidia,tegra30-gr3d";
			iommus = <&smmu TEGRA_SWGROUP_CELLS(NV)
					TEGRA_SWGROUP_CELLS(NV2)>;
			....
		};
