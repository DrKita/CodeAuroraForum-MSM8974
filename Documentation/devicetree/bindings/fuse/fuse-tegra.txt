NVIDIA Tegra20/Tegra30/Tegr114/Tegra124 fuse driver.

Required properties:
- compatible : should be:
	"nvidia,tegra20-efuse"
	"nvidia,tegra30-efuse"
	"nvidia,tegra114-efuse"
	"nvidia,tegra124-efuse"
  Details:
  nvidia,tegra20-efuse: Tegra20 requires using APB DMA to read the fuse data
	due to a hardware bug. Tegra20 also lacks certain information which is
	available in later generations such as fab code, lot code, wafer id,..
  nvidia,tegra30-efuse, nvidia,tegra114-efuse and nvidia,tegra124-efuse:
	The differences between these SoCs are the size of the efuse array,
	the location of the spare (OEM programmable) bits and the location of
	the speedo data.
- reg: Should contain 2 entries: the first entry gives the physical address
       and length of the fuse registers, the second entry gives the physical
       address and length of the apbmisc registers. These are used to provide
       the chipid, chip revision and strapping options.
- clocks: Should contain a pointer to the fuse clock.

Example:

        fuse@7000f800 {
                compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-efuse";
                reg = <0x7000F800 0x400>,
                      <0x70000000 0x400>;
                clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA20_CLK_FUSE>;
        };
