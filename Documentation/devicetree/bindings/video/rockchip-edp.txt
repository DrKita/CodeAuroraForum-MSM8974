Rockchip RK3288 EDP interface
================================

Required properties:
- compatible: "rockchip,rk3288-edp";

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length
- clocks: from common clock binding: handle to dp clock.
	of memory mapped region.
- clock-names: from common clock binding:
	Required elements: "clk_edp"
			"clk_edp_24m"
			"pclk_edp"
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
	See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
- reset-names: Must include the name "edp"

- rockchip,grf: this soc should set GRF regs, so need get grf here.
- rockchip,panel: required a simple panel node as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/panel/simple-panel.txt

- ports: contain a port node with endpoint definitions as defined in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:
	edp: edp@ff970000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-edp";
		reg = <0xff970000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 98 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_EDP>, <&cru SCLK_EDP_24M>, <&cru PCLK_EDP_CTRL>;
		clock-names = "clk_edp", "clk_edp_24m", "pclk_edp";
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		resets = <&cru 111>;
		reset-names = "edp";
		rockchip,panel = <&panel>;
		ports {
			edp_in: port {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				edp_in_vopb: endpoint@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vopb_out_edp>;
				};
				edp_in_vopl: endpoint@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vopl_out_edp>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
