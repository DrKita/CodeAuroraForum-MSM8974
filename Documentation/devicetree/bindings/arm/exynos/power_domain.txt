* Samsung Exynos Power Domains

Exynos processors include support for multiple power domains which are used
to gate power to one or more peripherals on the processor.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    * samsung,exynos4210-pd - for exynos4210 type power domain.
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
    region.
- clocks: List of clock handles. The parent clocks of the input clocks to the
  devices in this power domain are set to oscclk before power gating and
  restored back after powering on a domain. This is required for all domains
  which are powered on and off and not required for unused domains.
  The following clocks can be specified:
  - oscclk: oscillator clock.
  - clk(n): input clock to the devices in this power domain
  - pclk(n): parent clock of input clock to the devices in this power domain

Node of a device using power domains must have a samsung,power-domain property
defined with a phandle to respective power domain.

Example:

	lcd0: power-domain-lcd0 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10023C00 0x10>;
	};

	mfc_pd: pd@10044060 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-pd";
		reg = <0x10044060 0x20>;
		clocks = <&clock 1>, <&clock 1030>, <&clock 1031>;
		clock-names = "oscclk", "pclk0", "clk0";
	};

Example of the node using power domain:

	node {
		/* ... */
		samsung,power-domain = <&lcd0>;
		/* ... */
	};
