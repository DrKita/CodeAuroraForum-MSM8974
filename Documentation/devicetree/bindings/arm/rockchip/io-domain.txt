Rockchip SRAM for IO Voltage Domains:
-------------------------------------

IO domain voltages on some Rockchip SoCs are variable but need to be
kept in sync between the regulators and a special register.

We can specify which regulator is associated with which IO Voltage
Domain and then we can automatically adjust the register to match
what's actually being provided on the rails.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
  - "rockchip,rk3188-iodomain" for rk3188
  - "rockchip,rk3288-iodomain" for rk3288

You specify supplies using the standard regulator bindings by including
a phandle the the relevant regulator.  All specified supplies must be able
to report their voltage.  The IO Voltage Domain for any non-specified
supplies will be not be touched.

Possible supplies for rk3188:
- ap0-supply:    The supply connected to AP0_VCC.
- ap1-supply:    The supply connected to AP1_VCC.
- cif-supply:    The supply connected to CIF_VCC.
- flash-supply:  The supply connected to FLASH_VCC.
- lcdc0-supply:  The supply connected to LCD0_VCC.
- lcdc1-supply:  The supply connected to LCD1_VCC.
- vccio0-supply: The supply connected to VCCIO0.
- vccio1-supply: The supply connected to VCCIO1.
                 Sometimes also labeled VCCIO1 and VCCIO2.

Possible supplies for rk3288:
- audio-supply:  The supply connected to APIO4_VDD.
- bb-supply:     The supply connected to APIO5_VDD.
- dvp-supply:    The supply connected to DVPIO_VDD.
- flash0-supply: The supply connected to FLASH0_VDD.  Typically for eMMC
- flash1-supply: The supply connected to FLASH1_VDD.  Also known as SDIO1.
- gpio30-supply: The supply connected to APIO1_VDD.
- gpio1830       The supply connected to APIO2_VDD.
- lcdc-supply:   The supply connected to LCDC_VDD.
- sdcard-supply: The supply connected to SDMMC0_VDD.
- wifi-supply:   The supply connected to APIO3_VDD.  Also known as SDIO0.


Example:

	io-domains {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-iodomain";
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;

		audio-supply = <&vcc18_codec>;

		dvp-supply = <&vcc_18>;
		flash0-supply = <&vcc18_flashio>;
		gpio1830-supply = <&vcc33_io>;
		gpio30-supply = <&vcc33_pmuio>;
		lcdc-supply = <&vcc33_lcd>;
		sdcard-supply = <&vccio_sd>;
		wifi-supply = <&vcc18_wl>;
	};
