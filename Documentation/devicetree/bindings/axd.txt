* AXD Audio Processing IP Binding *

Required properties:
- compatible: "img,axd"
- clocks: phandle for the clock that drives AXD.
- interrupts: the GIC interrupt where AXD is connected or software interrupt
  1 (not recommended).

Optional properties:
- gic-irq: it takes two non-zero values, the first one is the host hwirq and
           the second one is axd's. Host's hwirq should match the value in
           interrupts.
           If not using GIC, then axd will revert to using software interrupt 1
           which is a fallback mechanism for systems without GIC. It is
           recommended to use GIC whenever possible. Some systems will only work
           with GIC so this property will not be optional then.
- vpe: VPE number on which axd should start. Must be provided if axd is
       running as a single VPE along Linux on the same core.
       It can't be VPE0.
       The VPE must be offlined by Linux before axd is loaded.
- inbuf-size: size of shared input buffers area. by default it's 0x7800 bytes.
- outbuf-size: size of shared output buffers area. by default it's 0x3c000 bytes.
- fw-base: base address where to load the firmware. This is required if not
           using CMA and will be ignored if using CMA.
- buf-base: base address of buffers area if not using CMA. This is required if
            not using CMA and will be ignored if using CMA.


Example:

		axdclk: axdclk@400M {
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			clock-frequency = <400000000>;
		};

		axd {
			compatible = "img,axd";
			clocks = <&axdclk>;
			interrupts = <36 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
			gic-irq = <36 37>;
			vpe = <1>;
		};
