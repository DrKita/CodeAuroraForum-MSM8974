DFLL board params node in the board DTS file

Required properties:
- sample-rate : control loop sample rate (in Hz)
- cf : I2C: duration to force the PMIC voltage after frequency change
- cg : loop gain (signed) - determined during board characterization
- ci : loop integral gain selector
- droop-cut-value : control output clock scaler at minimum ring osc freq
- droop-restore-ramp : clock recovery rate after a voltage droop event
- scale-out-ramp : voltage output ramp rate

Optional properties:
- no-output-forcing : don't force PMIC voltage output during request change
- fixed-output-forcing : force PMIC voltage during req change for a fixed time
- auto-output-forcing : force PMIC voltage during req change for a dynamic time
- cg-scale : if present, divide loop gain by 8 (see 'cg' above)

Note that one of 'no-output-forcing', 'fixed-output-forcing', or
'auto-output-forcing' must be specified.

Example:

cpu_dfll_board_params {
        sample-rate = <12500>;
        fixed-output-forcing;
        cf = <10>;
        ci = <0>;
        cg = <2>;
        droop-cut-value = <0xf>;
        droop-restore-ramp = <0x0>;
        scale-out-ramp = <0x0>;
};
