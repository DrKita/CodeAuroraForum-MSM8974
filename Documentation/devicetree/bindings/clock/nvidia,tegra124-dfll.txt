NVIDIA Tegra124 DFLL clocksource data in the SoC DTS file:

Required properties:
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra124-dfll"
- reg : Must contain the starting physical address and length for the
        DFLL's MMIO register space, including the DFLL-to-I2C
        controller interface and the DFLL's I2C controller.
- clocks : Must contain an array of two-cell arrays, one per clock.
           DFLL source clocks.  At minimum this should include the
           reference clock source and the IP block's main clock
           source.  Also it should contain the DFLL's I2C controller
           clock source.  The format is <&clock-provider-phandle
           clock-id>.
- clock-names : Must contain an array of strings, one per 'clocks'
                two-cell array.  The position in the array of these
                strings must correspond to the position in the 'clocks'
                array (see above).  The DFLL driver currently requires
                the "soc", "ref", and "i2c" clock names to be populated.

Optional properties:
- status : device availability -- managed by the DT integration code, not
           the DFLL driver.  Should be set to "disabled" in the SoC
           DTS file.

Example:

dfll@70110000 {
        compatible = "nvidia,tegra124-dfll";
        reg = <0x70110000 0x400>;
        clocks = <&tegra_car 265>, <&tegra_car 264>, <&tegra_car 47>;
        clock-names = "soc", "ref", "i2c";
        status = "disabled";
};

NVIDIA Tegra124 DFLL clocksource data in the board DTS file

Required properties:
- vdd-supply : phandle pointing to the DFLL's voltage regulator
- pmic-integration : phandle pointing to the PMIC integration data
                     for this DFLL instance
- board-params : phandle pointing to the board-specific tuning data
                 for this DFLL instance
- cvb-table : phandle pointing to the DFLL-specific CVB table for
              this DFLL instance

Optional properties:
- i2c-quiet-output-workaround : If the DFLL IP block version
                                implemented on this SoC requires the
                                I2C output to the PMIC to be quiesced
                                before disabling it, this property
                                should be set.
- status : device availability -- managed by the DT integration code, not
           the DFLL driver.  Should be set to "okay" if the DFLL is to be
           used on this board type.

Example:

dfll@70110000 {
        vdd-supply = <&vdd_cpu_reg>;
        board-params = <&{/cpu_dfll_board_params}>;
        pmic-integration = <&{/cpu_dfll_pmic_integration}>;
        status = "okay";
};
