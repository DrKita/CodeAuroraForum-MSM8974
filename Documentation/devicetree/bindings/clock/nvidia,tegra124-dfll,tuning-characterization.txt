DFLL silicon tuning characterization data in the DFLL DTS file

Required properties:
- speedo-id : Note that the properties in this node are applicable for chips
              with this Speedo ID set in the chip's fuses.  See also
              the 'process-id' property below.

- tune0-low-voltage-range: value to program into the DFLL_TUNE0
                           register when the DFLL's voltage rail is in
                           the low-voltage range. XXX This should be
                           broken up into the individual DFLL fields -
                           DT data shouldn't contain a raw register
                           value.

- tune0-high-voltage-range: value to program into the DFLL_TUNE0
                            register when the DFLL's voltage rail is in
                            the high-voltage range.  XXX This should be
                            broken up into the individual DFLL fields -
                            DT data shouldn't contain a raw register
                            value.

- tune1 : value to program into the DFLL_TUNE1 register. XXX This
          should be broken up into the individual DFLL fields - DT
          data shouldn't contain a raw register value.

- droop-rate-min : enable voltage droop control when the DVCO
                   frequency falls below this rate

- tune-high-min-millivolts : starting voltage of the DFLL's high-voltage range
                             (in millivolts).  The range between min-millivolts
                             and (tune-high-min-millivolts - 1) is the
                             low-voltage range.

- min-millivolts : starting voltage of the DFLL's low-voltage range (in
                   millivolts)

Optional properties:
- process-id : If present, indicates that the properties in this node only
               apply to chips with the matching process ID set in the chip's
               fuses.  'speedo-id' must also match the chip fuses.

The "address" of the characterization node is arbitrary and ignored.

Example:

cpu_dfll_tuning {
         ...

         characterization@1 {
                 speedo-id = <1>;
                 process-id = <0>;

                 tune0-low-voltage-range = <0x00b0039d>;
                 tune0-high-voltage-range = <0x00b0009d>;
                 tune1 = <0x0000001f>;
                 droop-rate-min = <1000000>;
                 tune-high-min-millivolts = <1000>;
                 min-millivolts = <900>;
         };
};
