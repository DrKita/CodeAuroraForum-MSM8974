* Samsung I2S controller

Required SoC Specific Properties:

- compatible : "samsung,samsung-i2s"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

[PRELIMINARY: the dma channel allocation will change once there are
official DMA bindings]

- tx-dma-channel-secondary: The dma channel specifier for secondary tx
  operations. The format of the dma specifier depends on the dma
  controller.
- tx-dma-channel: The dma channel specifier for tx operations. The format of
  the dma specifier depends on the dma controller.
- rx-dma-channel: The dma channel specifier for rx operations. The format of
  the dma specifier depends on the dma controller.

Optional SoC Specific Properties:

- samsung,supports-6ch: If the I2S Primary sound source has 5.1 Channel
  support, this flag is enabled.
- samsung,supports-rstclr: This flag should be set if I2S software reset bit
  control is required. When this flag is set I2S software reset bit will be
  enabled or disabled based on need.
- samsung,supports-secdai:If I2S block has a secondary FIFO and internal DMA,
  then this flag is enabled.
- samsung,idma-addr: Internal DMA register base address of the audio
  sub system(used in secondary sound source).

- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".

Aliases:

- All the I2S controller nodes are represented in the aliases node using
  the following format 'i2s{n}' where n is a unique number for the alias.

	compatible = "samsung,samsung-i2s";
	reg = <0x03830000 0x100>;
	tx-dma-channel-secondary = <&pdma0 8>;
	tx-dma-channel = <&pdma0 10>;
	rx-dma-channel = <&pdma0 9>;
	samsung,supports-6ch;
	samsung,supports-rstclr;
	samsung,supports-secdai;
	samsung,idma-addr = <0x03000000>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&i2s0_bus>;
};
