* Qualcomm Technologies LPASS CPU DAI

This node models the Qualcomm Technologies LPASS DAI ports.

Required properties:

- compatible		: "qcom,lpass-cpu"
- clocks		: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names		: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "ahbix-clk"
				* "mi2s-osr-clk"
				* "mi2s-bit-clk"
- interrupts		: Must contain an entry for each entry in
			  interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names	: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "lpass-irq-lpaif"
- pinctrl-N		: One property must exist for each entry in
			  pinctrl-names.  See ../pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
			  for details of the property values.
- pinctrl-names		: Must contain a "default" entry.
- reg			: Must contain an address for each entry in reg-names.
- reg-names		: A list which must include the following entries:
				* "lpass-lpaif"
				* "lpass-lpm"

Optional properties:

- qcom,system-clock-shift		: Add this bool property if the default
					  frequency of the system clock needs to
					  be reduced.
- qcom,system-clock-shift-compare	: A numerical value used to right-shift
					  the default system clock frequency for
					  comparison with the target bit clock
					  frequency.
- qcom,system-clock-shift-amount	: A numerical value used to right-shift
					  the default system clock frequency.
- qcom,alternate-sysclk			: Add this bool property if the default
					  frequency of the system clock cannot
					  divide down to the target bit clock
					  frequency.
- qcom,alternate-sysclk-bitwidth	: A numerical value representing the
					  sample bitwidth which requires use of
					  the alternate system clock frequency.
- qcom,alternate-sysclk-frequency	: A numerical value representing the new
					  system clock frequency to use.

Example:

lpass-cpu@28100000 {
	compatible = "qcom,lpass-cpu";
	clocks = <&lcc AHBIX_CLK>, <&lcc MI2S_OSR_CLK>, <&lcc MI2S_BIT_CLK>;
	clock-names = "ahbix-clk", "mi2s-osr-clk", "mi2s-bit-clk";
	interrupts = <0 85 1>;
	interrupt-names = "lpass-irq-lpaif";
	pinctrl-names = "default", "idle";
	pinctrl-0 = <&mi2s_default>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&mi2s_idle>;
	reg = <0x28100000 0x10000>, <0x28400000 0x4000>;
	reg-names = "lpass-lpaif", "lpass-lpm";
	qcom,system-clock-shift;
	qcom,system-clock-shift-compare = <4>;
	qcom,system-clock-shift-amount = <3>;
	qcom,alternate-sysclk;
	qcom,alternate-systclk-bitwidth = <24>;
	qcom,alternate-systclk-frequency = <4608000>;
};
