Required properties:

  - compatible : "maxim,max98090".

  - reg : the I2C address of the device for I2C

Optional properties:

  - interrupts : The interrupt line the IRQ signal tat the device is
    connected to.  This is optional, if it is not connected then none

Example:

max98090: max98090 {
	compatible = "maxim,max98090";
	reg = <0x10>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
	interrupts = <TEGRA_GPIO(H, 4) GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	dvdd-supply = <&gen_avdd_1v2>;
};
