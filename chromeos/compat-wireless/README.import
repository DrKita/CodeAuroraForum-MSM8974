This is almost stock compat-wireless; the only difference should be that the
top-level Makefile uses this:

NOSTDINC_FLAGS := -I$(M)/include/ -include $(M)/include/linux/compat-2.6.h

instead of this:

NOSTDINC_FLAGS := -I$(M)/include/ -include $(M)/include/linux/compat-2.6.h $(CFLAGS)

To import updated versions use the following recipe:

cd compat-wireless
tar xf <somewhere>/compat-wireless-2.6.34-rc4.tar.bz2 \
    --strip 1 -X ChromeOS-Xlist
<...edit Makefile for the change noted above...>

Be sure to check for files add/removed; it's a good idea to diff the
imported tree against the original tarball contents.

----
This code is built as part of the kernel ebuild when IUSE=compat_wireless
(the default).  Beware the ebuild work does configuration normally
done through the compat-wireless scripts.  In particular if you want to
add/change the supported drivers you need to change:

chromium-overlay/chromeos-base/kernel/kernel-*.ebuild

(look for the list of config options in compat_wireless_config in that file).

----
The udev helper scripts for loading compat-wireless firmware are
integreated ibnto the udev ebuild; look in chromium-overlay/sys-fs/udev.
